User can find questions in data.txt and ask the assistant. Keep in mind that this chatbot is not intelligence, it only works with limitted knowledge about a specific field/topic.

This assistant, through internet, has access to real data like weather and time. By remembering simple questions, you can quickly get info about weather conditions in some cities using the assistant
